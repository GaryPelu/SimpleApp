# SimpleApp
Sample App to test VSTS build automation from github.

The functionality of this sample is very simple and most C# developers would not learn anything new.

The application takes a string argument and spits out the characters of the string in reverse order to the Console.  It also illustrates the use of Unit Testing public methods.

The purpose is to have a VSTS account point to this repo and build and test the sample.
